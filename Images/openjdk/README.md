# Image Tags

These base images are tagged with the Java OpenJDK version plus the image build date.  The most recent build will be tagged as **latest**.

From time-to-time you may see images tagged like `:BRANCH-*` where **BRANCH** identifies the Git source branch where the image was built from.  These images are used for internal development purposes only and **should not be used production** as they may not actually work and may also be removed or updated at any time.

The [$/Doc/ImageSource] folder is used to organize the source files (e.g. Visio drawings) used to generate images that are embedded into GitHub issues.

As a convention, each subfolder may include a **Source** folder.  These will hold any source documents (like Visio drawings) that were used to generate the image files.  These will generally be organized into folders named by the numeric **issue ID**.

These files are available in case an issue image needs to be updated by modifying the underlying drawing.

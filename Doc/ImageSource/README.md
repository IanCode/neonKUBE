The [$/Doc/ImageSource] folder is used to organize the source files (e.g. Visio drawings) used to generate images that are embedded into GitHub issues or Wiki.

As a convention, each subfolder may include a **Source** folder.  These will hold any source documents (like Visio drawings) that were used to generate the image files.  These will generally be organized into folders named by the numeric **issue ID** or within a **Wiki** subfolder at the same level as the referencing article from the GitHub Wiki.

These files are available in case an issue image needs to be updated by modifying the underlying drawing.

Build and Package
-----------------

The instructions below describe how to build the plugin as well
as its Debian package.

	1. Edit [version.txt] to have version number (as a single line)
	2. 


Vendor Dependencies
-------------------

This project uses the GO [dep] tool to manage reference vendor packages.
Occasionally, you may need to update these packages.  This can be accomplished
via the following commands:

# Start the GOLANG container, mounting the project directory:

docker run -it --rm --entrypoint=bash -v %NF_ROOT%\Tools:/src neoncluster/golang

# Run these commands inside the container.

cd /src/neon-volume-plugin
rm Gopkg.*
rm -r vendor/*
dep init
exit

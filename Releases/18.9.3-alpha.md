# Release: 18.9.3-alpha

## Components

* **neon-cli:** `18.9.3-alpha`
* **neon lib:** `18.9.3-alpha`

## Overview



## Upgrade

1. Run this command to upgrade existing hives: `neon hive update`

## Changes

* [#337 HiveMQ bootstrap settings](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/337): Hive setup now persists the bootstrap settings as a Consul hive global.
* [#326 Virtual machine creation seems really slow during hive deploy](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/326): Added the `XenServerOptions.Snapshot` property to enable fast snapshots when possible.  This is still disabled by default since that is likely not appropriate for production hives.
* [#339 Docker services restarting under load](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/339): Updated `/etc/security/limits.conf` and added `/etc/systemd/user.conf.d/50-neon.conf`.

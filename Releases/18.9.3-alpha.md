# Release: 18.9.3-alpha

## Components

* **neon-cli:** `18.9.3-alpha`
* **neon lib:** `18.9.3-alpha`

## Overview



## Upgrade

1. Run this command to upgrade existing hives: `neon hive update`

## Changes

### Breaking Hive Changes

**NONE:** No changes requiring hive redeployment.

### Breaking Library Changes

* **Neon.Common:** `NetHelper.GetReachableHosts()` now returns a `ReachableHost` instance rather than the hostname as a string.  This includes more information like the target IP address, round-trip time, and an indication of whether the host was actually reachable.

### Other Changes

* [#337 HiveMQ bootstrap settings](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/337): Hive setup now persists the bootstrap settings as a Consul hive global.
* [#326 Virtual machine creation seems really slow during hive deploy](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/326): Added the `XenServerOptions.Snapshot` property to enable fast snapshots when possible.  This is still disabled by default since that is likely not appropriate for production hives.
* [#339 Docker services restarting under load](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/339): Updated `/etc/security/limits.conf` and added `/etc/systemd/user.conf.d/50-neon.conf`.
* [#344 neon-registry-cache containers are restarting](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/344): Fixed entry point script problems.
* [#345 Cleanup: Update images to exec tini via /sbin/tini to avoid Alpine deprecation warnings](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/345)

# Release: 18.9.2-alpha

I'm replacing the *preview* tag with **alpha**.  The idea is that we'll use this for unstable releases and use **preview-#** for releases we actually expect some end users to try.

## Components

* **neon-cli:** `18.9.2-alpha`
* **neon lib:** `18.9.2-alpha`

## Overview

**BREAKING:** This is hopefully the last neonHIVE release that requires full cluster redeployment.

This release fixes some HiveMQ deployment issues (I had to remove the leading "/" from RabbitMQ virtual hosts) and I also changed `Ceph` to `HiveFS` for hive definition files and renamed the **Ceph** dashboard to **HIveFS**.

## Upgrade

1. Edit your hive definition (JSON) files to change `Ceph` properties to `HiveFS`.
2. Then redeploy all hives.

## Changes

* **BREAKING:** Renamed the RabbitMQ virtual hosts from `/neon` and `/app` to `neon` and `app`.
* **BREAKING:** Renamed `Ceph` to `HiveFS` for hive definition files.
* **BREAKING:** Renamed `Ceph` dashboard to `HiveFS`.
* `HiveFixture` now supports HiveMQ.

* Added the `HiveProxy.HiveMQ` management property.  This currently returns `HiveMQSettings` for the root **/**, **app**, and **neon** virtual hosts.

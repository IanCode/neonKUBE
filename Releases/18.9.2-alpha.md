# Release: 18.9.2-alpha

I'm replacing the *preview* tag with **alpha**.  The idea is that we'll use this for unstable releases and use **preview-#** for releases we actually expect end users to try.

## Components

* **neon-cli:** `18.9.2-alpha`
* **neon lib:** `18.9.2-alpha`

## Overview

## Upgrade

1. Run this command to update each hive: `neon hive update`

## Changes

* Added the `HiveProxy.HiveMQ` management property.  This currently returns `HiveMQSettings` for the root **/**, **/app**, and **/neon** virtual hosts.

# Release: 18.12.0-alpha.7

## Components

* **neon-cli:** `18.12.0-alpha.7`
* **neon lib:** `18.12.0-alpha.7`

## Highlights

**Libs:** This is considered a **non-BREAKING** release.
**Hive:** This is a **NON-BREAKING** release because existing hives can be upgraded.


## Upgrade

Run this command for all hives:

```
neon hive update
```

## Library Changes

### Neon.Common

* [Neon.Common]: Removed unnecessary [Microsoft.AspNetCore] dependency.

### Neon.Hive

* **BREAKING:** Renamed . `NetworkOptions.WorkerPublicAddress` to `NodePublicAddress` This is technically a breaking change but nobody is actually using this yet.

* Added `HiveHelper.GetTempFolder()`.

### Neon.Xunit

## neon-cli Changes

* [neon hive setup] no longer uses the `--machine-username` and `--machine-password` command line options so that [neon hive prepare] can customize these as required (e.g. cloud deployments need secure passwords).  Setup now picks these up from the interim hive login 
* [neon login]: Deletes the current login file when login fails.

## Hive Changes

* Azure deployment works again!
  * Azure resource group now defaults to the hive name.
  * Renamed some of the *worker...* related assets to *node...* for consistency because these also cover pets.

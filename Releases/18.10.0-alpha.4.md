# Release: 18.10.0-alpha.4

## Release version convention changes

The versioning convention has been again changed for this release, hopefully for the final time.  Here's what we'll do going forward:

* Stable, Edge and and LTS releases will continue to use the **YY.M.PATCH** convention where the month.
* Patch releases are guaranteed to be backwards compatible.
* Releases where one or both of YY or M were advanced may not be backwards compatible but we'll try very hard to avoid these issues or provide an upgrade path.
* The month field **will not** include a leading **""0""** due to NuGet issues.
* Intermediate development releases will use versions like: **YY.M.0-alpha.N** where **YY.M* specifies the actual date for the release and **N** starts at **0** and is incremented for every development release made since the Stable, Edge, or LTS release.  Intermediate releases are not generally intended for public consumption.
* Intermediate public releases are called previews.  There are types of preview release:
  * Preview of a patch release for an existing release.  This will look like **YY.M.PATCH-preview-N** where **PATCH** is the scheduled patch number and **N** starts at **0** and is incremented for every preview release for the patch.
  * Preview of an upcoming Stable, Edge, or LTS release.  These release versions will look like **YY.M.0-preview-B** where **YY.M** is the expected release month.
* If a Stable, Edge, or LTS release slips passed the scheduled release month, we'll retain the old month for up to 15 days into the next month.  Past that, we'll update **YY.M** to the actual published month.

## Components

* **neon-cli:** `18.10.0-alpha.4`
* **neon lib:** `18.10.0-alpha.4`

## Overview

This is considered a **non-breaking** release with:

* Elasticsearch rebased on OpenJDK 9/10 so that CGROUP memory limits will be honored
* RabbitMQ related enhancements:
  * `Neon.Xunit.RabbitMQ` library providing a test fixture
  * `RabbitMQFixture`: a fast Docker based test fixture
  * `HiveBus` API in `Neon.HiveMQ`: a more flexible API built on EasyMQ
* Bug fixes (see below)

Note that although there are some breaking library changes described below, we don't expect any users to be impacted.

## Upgrade

1. Run this command for all hives: `neon hive update`

## Library Changes

### Neon.Common

* **BREAKING:** Relocated classes to the `Neon.Tasks` namespace: `AsyncAutoResetEvent`, `AsyncManualResetEvent`, `AsyncMutex`, `AsyncReaderWriterLock`.

* Added the `NeonHelper.OsDescription` and `FrameworkDescription` properties.
* Added the `NeonHelper.GetEntryAssembltPath()` method.
* Added the `AsyncPeriodicTask` class.

### Neon.Hive

**BREAKING:** `DnsHostsManager` class renamed to `DnsManager` and `HiveProxy.DnsHosts` property renamed to just `Dns` in keeping with the "hive DNS" terminology change.  This is unlikely to impact anyone.
**BREAKING:** `GlobalsManager.TryGetJson()` renamed to `TryGetObject()` and `SetJson()` renamed to `Set()`.  This is unlikely to impact anyone.

**Neon.Hive:** Added the `LoadBalancerRule.Normalize(bool)` method to fix change detection in unit tests.

### Neon.HiveMQ

* The `HiveBus` API now ensures that each queue create has at least one message consumer so that queue auto delete will work.

### Neon.Xunit

**BREAKING: Neon.Xunit.Hive:** Renamed `includeCore` parameter to `includeSystem` to test fixtures for consistency.  This is unlikely to impact anyone.

**Neon.Xunit:** `ContainerFixture.RunContainer()` now pulls the container image first.
**Neon.Xunit:** `DockerFixture.Reset()` ensures that all stacks are removed before resetting swarm mode to prevent orphaned networks.

### Neon.Xunit.Couchbase

**BREAKING: Neon.Xunit.Couchbase:** Renamed `CouchbaseFixture.Flush()` to `Clear()`.  This is unlikely to impact anyone.

### Neon.Xunit.RabbitMQ

**Neon.Xunit.RabbitMQ:** Published this new library to enable fast RabbitMQ based unit tests.  `RabbitMQFixture` is the new test fixture.
**Neon.Xunit.RabbitMQ:** [#361 Basic RabbitMQ client API](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/361)

## neon-cli Changes

* Command renamed: [neon loadbalancer|lb * deploy] --> [neon loadbalancer|lb * update]

## Hive Changes

* [#340 [neon_docker_login] Ansible module setting wrong [.docker/config.conf] file permissions](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/340)
* [#342 [log-collector]: Strip port from [proxy.http_host] log fields](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/342)
* [#350 [log-collector]: Add generic text and numeric fields to the Elasticsearch logstash index](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/350)
* [#352 Upgrade Elasticsearch images to OpenJDK 10](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/352)
* [#357 OpenJDK: Use the official images and delete [nhive/openjdk]](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/357)
* [#360 Implement RabbitMQ test container and unit test fixture](https://github.com/jefflill/NeonForge/issues/360)

* **neon-hive-manager** now periodically broadcasts HiveMQ messages that signal to **neon-proxy-manager** that it should attempt to regenerate the proxy/bridge configurations.  `neon-cli` will also broadcast this signal whenever load balancer rules or TLS certificates are changed.  This replaces the old polling behavior.
* The HiveMQ AMQP load balancer rule was incorrectly created as an **HTTP** rather than a **TCP** proxy in past versions.  This will be deleted and recreated as TCP during hive update.
* The **neon/global/log-rentention-days** hive variable was misspelled.  A new variable correctly named `log-rentention-days` will be created using the old value and the misspelled variable will be retained for backwards compatibility.
* Simplified some services by using the new `AsyncPeriodicTask` class: **neon-dns**, **neon-dns-mon**, and **neon-hive-manager**.
